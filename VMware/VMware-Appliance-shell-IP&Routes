#This file contains tasks that can be done on VMware appliance shell.  You should know the basics of the vi text editor.

#Option 1. IP Address configuration
Interface information if stored in the following location.
/etc/systemd/network/
each interface has its own file. eth# states the interface that which the file corresponds.
/etc/systemd/network/10-eth0.network
/etc/systemd/network/10-eth1.network

#vi /etc/systemd/network/10-eth0.network
[Match]
Name=eth0

[Network]
Gateway=172.16.32.1 #This line is only on the interface with the default gateway.
Address=172.16.32.139/24
DHCP=no

[DHCP]
UseDNS=false

[Route] #Only add this section to interface that will host the static routes.  Mostly interfaces without default gateway.
Gateway=192.168.1.20
Destination=192.168.2.0/24



2. Routing -- Edit routes file
file path /etc/sysconfig/network/routes
edit file vi /etc/sysconfig/network/routes

context
the default route if in the file should look like this
default 10.10.10.1 - -

add any new static persitent routes bellow the default using the follow format.
"Destination Network" "Gateway/Nexthop Address" "Subnetmask of destination network" "interface"
or
172.16.32.0 192.168.101.1 255.255.255.0 eth1
192.168.210.0 192.168.230.1 255.255.255.0 eth2

3. Non-persistent Routes
This command will add routes that are not persistent and will clearout after a reboot.
route add -net <TargetNetwork> netmask <NetmaskAddress> gw <GatewayAddress> dev <interface>
route add -net 23.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 gw 214.38.138.129 dev eth1
